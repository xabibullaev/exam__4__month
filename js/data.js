            "Python is fast becoming the programming language of choice for hackers, reverse engineers, and software testers because it's easy to write quickly, and it has the low-level support and libraries that make hackers happy. But until now, there has been no real manual on how to use Python for a variety of hacking tasks. You had to dig through forum posts and man pages, endlessly tweaking your own code to get everything working. Not anymore. Gray Hat Python explains the concepts behind hacking tools and techniques like debuggers, trojans, fuzzers, and emulators. But author Justin Seitz goes beyond theory, showing you how to harness existing Python-based security tools—and how to build your own when the pre-built ones won't cut it. You'll learn how to: –Automate tedious reversing and security tasks –Design and program your own debugger –Learn how to fuzz Windows drivers and create powerful fuzzers from scratch –Have fun with code and library injection, soft and hard hooking techniques, and other software trickery –Sniff secure traffic out of an encrypted web browser session –Use PyDBG, Immunity Debugger, Sulley, IDAPython, PyEMU, and more The world's best hackers are using Python to do their handiwork. Shouldn't you?",

            'Python is a powerful, expressive programming language that’s easy to learn and fun to use! But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that’s no fun for anyone. Python for Kids brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side. Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you’ll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and "Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more. As you strike out on your programming adventure, you’ll learn how to: –Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps –Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules –Use control structures like loops and conditional statements –Draw shapes and patterns with Python’s turtle module –Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter Why should serious adults have all the fun? Python for Kids is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming. For kids ages 10+ (and their parents) The code in this book runs on almost anything: Windows, Mac, Linux, even an OLPC laptop or Raspberry Pi!',

            "When it comes to creating powerful and effective hacking tools, Python is the language of choice for most security analysts. But just how does the magic happen? In Black Hat Python, the latest from Justin Seitz (author of the best-selling Gray Hat Python), you’ll explore the darker side of Python’s capabilities—writing network sniffers, manipulating packets, infecting virtual machines, creating stealthy trojans, and more. You’ll learn how to: –Create a trojan command-and-control using GitHub –Detect sandboxing and automate com\u00admon malware tasks, like keylogging and screenshotting –Escalate Windows privileges with creative process control –Use offensive memory forensics tricks to retrieve password hashes and inject shellcode into a virtual machine –Extend the popular Burp Suite web-hacking tool –Abuse Windows COM automation to perform a man-in-the-browser attack –Exfiltrate data from a network most sneakily Insider techniques and creative challenges throughout show you how to extend the hacks and how to write your own exploits. When it comes to offensive security, your ability to create powerful tools on the fly is indispensable. Learn how in Black Hat Python. Uses Python 2",

            "Learn how to write idiomatic, effective Python code by leveraging its best features. Python's simplicity quickly lets you become productive with it, but this often means you aren't using everything the language has to offer. By taking you through Python's key language features and libraries, this practical book shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable all at the same time—what experts considerPythonic. Many programmers who learn Python basics fall into the trap of reinventing the wheel because of past experience in other languages, and try to bend the language to patterns that don't really apply to it. Author Luciano Ramalho, a Python Software Foundation member and Python programmer for 15 years, helps you drop your accent from another language so you can code Python fluently. Learn practical applications of generators for database processing Rethink some design patterns in a Python context Examine attribute descriptors and when to use them: the key to ORMs Explore Pythonic objects: protocols versus interfaces, abstract base classes and multiple inheritance",

But what if you could have your computer do them for you? In Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, you’ll learn how to use Python to write programs that do in minutes what would take you hours to do by hand—no prior programming experience required. Once you’ve mastered the basics of programming, you’ll create Python programs that effortlessly perform useful and impressive feats of automation to: Search for text in a file or across multiple filesCreate, update, move, and rename files and foldersSearch the Web and download online contentUpdate and format data in Excel spreadsheets of any sizeSplit, merge, watermark, and encrypt PDFsSend reminder emails and text notificationsFill out online forms Step-by-step instructions walk you through each program, and practice projects at the end of each chapter challenge you to improve those programs and use your newfound skills to automate similar tasks. Don’t spend your time doing work a well-trained monkey could do. Even if you’ve never written a line of code, you can make your computer do the grunt work. Learn how in Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. Note: The programs in this book are written to run on Python 3.",
